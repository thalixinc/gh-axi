# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Dependency bumps and the lockfile

The committed `pnpm-lock.yaml` is Prettier-formatted (multi-line `resolution:` and `engines:` blocks), which is not pnpm's native output format.
A plain `pnpm install` rewrites those blocks inline and produces a ~1000-line cosmetic churn even when only one dependency actually changed.
After bumping a dependency, run `pnpm exec prettier --write pnpm-lock.yaml` so the diff collapses to just the real change.
CI uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, which parses the YAML structurally and accepts the Prettier-formatted lockfile, so the formatting does not break the frozen-install check.

## The SDK-provided `update` command

`gh-axi` runs its CLI through `runAxiCli` from `axi-sdk-js` (`src/cli.ts`) and registers no `update` command of its own.
Since `axi-sdk-js@0.1.8` ships `update` as a `RESERVED_COMMANDS` built-in, `gh-axi` inherits `gh-axi update` for free, and the SDK auto-resolves the npm package name (`gh-axi`) by walking up to the nearest `package.json`.
The SDK also appends a `"built-in":` section to the top-level `--help` output at runtime, so `src/cli.ts`'s `TOP_HELP` constant is a prefix of the rendered help rather than the whole thing.

## Release process

Releases are cut by release-please from conventional commit messages on `main`; merging the bot's release PR triggers `npm publish` via `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.

This fork (`thalixinc/gh-axi`) still carries the upstream release-please + npm-publish path (publishing `gh-axi` on npm). Publishing `@thalixinc/gh-axi` under our own scope requires re-pointing `release-please-manifest` + registry scope — parked as a separate ticket (cof), not in scope here.
Do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or `.release-please-manifest.json` (a guard workflow blocks PRs that touch them), and regenerate `skills/gh-axi/SKILL.md` with `pnpm run build:skill` instead of editing it directly.

Every `pull_request` workflow (`ci.yml`, `guard-generated-files.yml`, `no-mistakes-required.yml`) uses `paths-ignore` for the release-please output set (`.release-please-manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json`) so release PRs create zero runs. Job-level bot `if`s stay as defense in depth. `test/release-ci-exclusions.test.ts` derives that set from `release-please-config.json` and fails if a workflow drifts; update the ignore lists when adding `extra-files` or changing `release-type`.

## Installable skill (`src/skill.ts` → `skills/gh-axi/SKILL.md`)

The shipped skill stays a minimal stub and defers to the CLI for all actual guidance. gh-axi CLI output (`gh-axi` dashboard, `gh-axi --help`, `gh-axi <command> --help`) is the single source of truth. Never re-duplicate CLI-owned instructions into the skill; prefer a pointer over restated detail.

## GitHub Enterprise host support (`src/host.ts`, `src/cli.ts`)

`gh-axi` targets a custom GitHub host (e.g. a GHE server like `ghe.example.com`) via a global `--hostname <host>` flag or the `GH_HOST` env var; explicit `--hostname` wins.
Like `-R`/`--repo`, `--hostname` must come _after_ the command (the SDK rejects leading flags), and it is stripped from the args before they reach the underlying `gh` (it is never a subcommand flag).
`src/cli.ts`'s `resolveContext` sets `process.env.GH_HOST` only when `--hostname` is present; the child `gh` process inherits `process.env`, so no explicit env is threaded through `gh.ts`. When no `--hostname` is given, `GH_HOST` is left untouched, keeping the default (github.com) behavior byte-for-byte identical.
`src/host.ts#resolveHost()` (flag > `GH_HOST` > `github.com`) is the single source of truth for the effective host used when _building or parsing_ URLs — `parseRemoteUrl` in `src/context.ts` matches the configured host in `git remote` URLs, and `issue transfer`'s fallback URL is built as `https://<host>/...`. The `gh pr create` output regex (`/pull/(\d+)/`) is already host-agnostic.

## Secret/variable value input (`src/secretValue.ts`, `src/stdin.ts`, `gh.ts#ghExecWithStdin`)

`gh secret list`/`gh variable list` do not support `--limit` or any pagination flag (unlike `issue`/`pr`/`release` list), so `secret.ts`/`variable.ts` list all results in one call with no `--limit` flag of their own.

Secret values must never appear in argv (visible via `ps`) or stdout.
`secretCommand`'s `set` subcommand is stdin-only: it rejects `--body`/`-b`, calls `resolveValue(undefined, "secret")`, and pipes the resolved value to `gh.ts#ghExecWithStdin` so the wrapped `gh secret set` child also never receives the value in argv.
Variable values are not treated as secrets: `variableCommand`'s `set` subcommand may resolve the value from `--body`/`-b` or piped stdin (`resolveValue` in `src/secretValue.ts`, backed by `src/stdin.ts`), and `gh-axi variable list` intentionally prints variable values.
`variable set --body` values are visible in the `gh-axi` process argv, but `ghExecWithStdin` still keeps them out of the child `gh variable set` argv.
`resolveValue` throws immediately instead of blocking when stdin is an interactive TTY and no usable value source was provided, since AXI commands must never hang waiting for interactive input.

`secretCommand`'s `list`/`set`/`delete` forward `--env`/`-e <environment>` to `gh secret ... --env` via `resolveScope` in `src/commands/secret.ts`; the repo/host context flags are already stripped in `cli.ts` before the command sees its args, so `-R`/`--hostname` compose with `--env` for free. `resolveScope` is deliberately strict: a malformed `--env` (missing/empty value), conflicting `--env` flags, gh's other scopes (`--org`/`--user`/`--app`, plus the value-channel `--env-file`), and any unknown flag all throw loudly rather than silently falling back to repo scope. Unknown flags are echoed by name only (the `=value` is stripped) so a secret value can never leak into an error message.

## User-scoped commands (`src/commands/gist.ts`, `src/commands/project.ts`)

Some GitHub API endpoints are user-scoped rather than repo-scoped: `gh api /gists` and `gh project` have no `--repo` flag and reject it if supplied.
`gh.ts#buildArgs` auto-appends `--repo <nwo>` for any `RepoContext` whose `source !== "git"`, so passing ctx to `ghJson` from these handlers would inject a flag the CLI rejects.
The fix is structural: these command functions omit the `ctx` parameter entirely (TypeScript accepts `(args: string[])` as `CommandFn` because fewer params are always assignable).
`cli.ts`'s `withRepoContext` wrapper still resolves a context for other commands — it just never reaches `ghJson` in the user-scoped handlers.
`gist.ts` follows this pattern; `project.ts` does too (though it additionally uses ctx?.owner for owner defaulting, it never forwards ctx to `ghJson`).

## GitHub Projects (`gh project`) support (`src/commands/project.ts`)

Unlike every other command family, `gh project` is owner-scoped (`--owner <login>`), not repo-scoped — it has no `--repo` flag at all.
`project.ts`'s subfunctions therefore never pass `RepoContext` as the second arg to `ghJson` (matching `search.ts`'s existing pattern) — see "User-scoped commands" above for why.
Instead, `resolveOwner()` defaults `--owner` to the current repo's owner (`ctx?.owner`) when the flag is omitted and a repo context is available, falling back to explicit `@me` otherwise because `gh project` requires an owner in non-interactive shells.
`gh project` subcommands use `--format json` (whole-object dump), not the `--json field,field` selection style used by `issue`/`pr`/`release`; list-shaped responses come back wrapped (e.g. `{ projects: [...], totalCount }`), not as a bare array.
Since Projects v2 items carry per-project custom fields (Status, Priority, ...) with no fixed schema, `item-list`/`field-list` render through bespoke functions (`renderProjectItems`/`renderProjectFields`) that flatten any unknown scalar top-level key into its own column, rather than a fixed `FieldDef` schema.
Requires the `project` (or `read:project`) OAuth scope on the `gh` token; `src/errors.ts` matches gh's literal `"authentication token is missing required scopes [...]"` stderr (verified against a live token missing the scope) and maps it to `FORBIDDEN` with a `gh auth refresh -s <scope>` suggestion — this pattern is generic, not project-specific, so it also covers other gh features gated by OAuth scopes.

## Help text is the flag contract (`test/help-examples.test.ts`)

Agents read `--help` as the complete list of flags a subcommand accepts, so every entry in a family's `*_FLAGS` table must appear in the matching `flags{<sub>}:` section of its `*_HELP` string.
`test/help-examples.test.ts` enforces that direction (FLAGS subset of HELP) by importing the tables themselves — which is the only reason `ISSUE_FLAGS`, `PR_FLAGS`, `RUN_FLAGS`, `WORKFLOW_FLAGS`, `RELEASE_FLAGS`, `REPO_FLAGS`, `LABEL_FLAGS`, `PROJECT_FLAGS`, `VARIABLE_FLAGS` and `SEARCH_FLAGS` are exported.
The parser reads a `flags{<sub>}:` header naming exactly one subcommand plus its two-space-indented continuation lines; matching is whole-token, so `--log-failed` does not stand in for `--log`.
`issue list --search` and `pr list --search` are exempt via `UNDOCUMENTED_ON_PURPOSE` because they exist only to be rejected with a hint pointing at `gh-axi search`; add an exemption only for a flag that always fails, never to silence a real gap.
`api`, `gist`, `secret` and `stack` declare their accepted flags differently and are not covered.

## Repeatable flags (`src/args.ts`)

`gh` accepts `--label`, `--assignee`, `--reviewer`, `--project`, and the `--add-*`/`--remove-*` variants once per value, so gh-axi must collect _every_ occurrence.
Use `getAllFlags`/`takeAllFlags` plus `pushRepeated`; `getFlag`/`takeFlag` keep only the first occurrence and silently discard the rest, which is the bug that recurred as #55, #57, and #75.
Both collectors reject a dangling (`--label` with nothing after it) or blank (`--label=`) value with a `VALIDATION_ERROR` instead of dropping it.
Pick the collector that matches the surrounding file: `issue.ts` reads args non-destructively (`getAllFlags`), `pr.ts` consumes them (`takeAllFlags`).
When a flag becomes repeatable, mark it `(repeatable)` in that command's `*_HELP` string.

## Local guards on pass-through flags (`src/commands/pr.ts`)

gh rejects some flag combinations at parse time (`--merge`/`--squash`/`--rebase`, and `--auto`/`--disable-auto`/`--admin`), and gh-axi mirrors those conflicts locally as a `VALIDATION_ERROR` before any gh call.
The mirror is not redundant: several commands run an idempotency `gh ... view` first, so a locally caught conflict saves an API round trip and yields a mapped error instead of gh's raw flag usage dump.
Verify the real conflict against the installed gh (`gh pr merge 999999 --admin --auto -R <repo>` surfaces a flag error without touching a PR) rather than inferring it from the help text.

`takeBoolFlag` in `src/args.ts` matches whole tokens only, while `rejectUnknownFlags` compares the flag name with any `=value` stripped, so a known boolean written as `--flag=value` clears the guard and is then dropped without a word.
`prMerge` closes that gap for its own on/off switches with `rejectValuedMergeSwitches`, which throws a `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the offending token before any gh call; a command adding its own boolean flag needs the same guard until the shared helper learns the `=value` form.
Run such a guard over the raw argv as the first statement of the handler: once a value-taking option has parsed, `--body --admin=true` has already been consumed as body text and there is no token left to reject.

## gh stderr classification (`src/errors.ts`)

`mapGhError` walks `patterns` in order and returns on the first regex hit, so **order is the contract**: a narrow, specific pattern must sit ahead of any broader one it would otherwise be swallowed by.
gh sometimes embeds remediation hints in errors with a different root cause, so check new patterns against real stderr and place specific carriers of a generic hint first rather than narrowing the generic match.
`test/errors.test.ts` pins the repo-resolution and genuine-auth cases.

## `--version` fast path (`bin/gh-axi.ts`, `src/version.ts`)

`bin/gh-axi.ts` answers a bare `-v`/`-V`/`--version` via `tryFastPath` from `axi-sdk-js/fast-path` (a dependency-free SDK subpath) and only `await import("../src/cli.js")` otherwise, so the version path never loads the command graph (~31ms -> ~20ms, the node floor).
This only works because `src/version.ts` is a LEAF module importing node builtins only - `cli.ts` imports `VERSION` from it, never the reverse. Adding any non-builtin import to `src/version.ts` silently undoes the speedup.
`test/version-fast-path.test.ts` guards it deterministically with a `module.register()` load-hook trace (`test/fixtures/module-trace-*.mjs`) plus a negative control on `--help`. Do not add a wall-clock timing assertion; it was proven flaky under CI contention.

## Stacked PR support (`src/commands/stack.ts`)

`gh-axi stack` is deliberately a strict adapter over the official `github/gh-stack` extension, not a second stack engine. Keep local metadata, Git mutation, rebase recovery, and Stacks API behavior upstream.
Stack commands are cwd-bound. `cli.ts#withLocalRepoContext` rejects explicit repo flags and `GH_REPO`, strips the supported host flag, and never passes a `RepoContext` to `ghRaw`, because the extension does not accept `--repo`.
Successful extension status is commonly written to stderr, and exits 2-10 represent actionable stack state. Preserve both streams and the exact `StackError.exitCode`, which reaches the shell only through `cli.ts`'s `formatError` hook; do not replace `ghRaw` with `ghExec` or generic `mapGhError`.
Never expose an interactive path. Force `view --json`, `submit --auto`, and `merge --yes`; require arguments for commands that otherwise prompt. Keep `modify`, `switch`, `alias`, and `feedback` out unless upstream gains a useful headless interface.

## Repeatable `--attach` (`src/attach.ts`)

`--attach <path[#alt]>` is repeatable on `issue`/`pr` `create`, `edit`, and `comment` (gh itself does not offer it on `pr review`). gh-axi checks the wrapped binary (`GH_BIN` or `gh` on PATH) is >= 2.99.0 before validation, then forwards values unchanged so gh owns parsing, validation, and upload behavior. Tests resolve that binary from `GH_BIN`, then a worktree `.tools/gh-2.99.0/**/bin/gh`, then PATH. Live upload tests also need `GH_AXI_TEST_REPO` set to a captain-owned test repo, never a product repo.

## Raising PRs to upstream

**Scope: upstream (`kunchenguid/gh-axi`) only.** Intra-fork PRs targeting `thalixinc/gh-axi` carry no no-mistakes gate — they are raised plain and merged via cof-review. The no-mistakes ceremony below governs raising PRs to Kun Chen's upstream only.

Human-authored PRs targeting `main` must be raised through [`no-mistakes`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes) (`no-mistakes init --fork-url git@github.com:<you>/gh-axi.git`, then `git push no-mistakes`): the `Require no-mistakes` workflow fails any PR whose body lacks the pipeline's deterministic signature, and maintainer triage treats hand-raised PRs as blocked. Do not push a PR branch straight to `origin`. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

`.github/workflows/no-mistakes-required.yml` is a thin caller of the shared `kunchenguid/no-mistakes/.github/actions/require-no-mistakes` composite action, pinned to an immutable commit SHA and never `@main` (main is editable by the very PR the gate judges). Enforcement logic - the `Updates from [git push no-mistakes]` signature check, the `<!-- no-mistakes-pipeline-attestation:v1 {...} -->` parse, and the head binding - and its tests live upstream in the no-mistakes repository; change enforcement there rather than copying it locally, and bump this repository's pin in a deliberate separate pull request. This repository still owns its `on:`, `paths-ignore`, `concurrency`, `permissions`, job name, and author-exemption `if:`.
The shared action's head binding means a PR whose body no-mistakes did not rewrite for the current head goes red. That is the attestation contract, not a flake: push through `git push no-mistakes` so the body is refreshed.
